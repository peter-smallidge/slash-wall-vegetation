### Analysis of seedling heights 2020

```{r, include=FALSE}

#
# ALT plus hypen = <- (within chunk)
# ctrl plus shift plus m = %>% 
# ctrl + ALT + I = insert chunk
# filter rows, select columns

```

### read data from csv file, check variables and data structure

<!-- note to self: in the "read_csv" code, after the file location the code
for 'col..." etc ensures that the specified column is adjusted
the file "cheat sheet data-import" has details 

It is also possible to right-click a file name and import excel
