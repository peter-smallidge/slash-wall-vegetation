### sample code to graph cumulative summations
#### plot height growth of seedlings through time, facet by species

```{r}

```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# read datafile
# 
coronavirus <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/master/csv/coronavirus.csv', col_types = cols(province = col_character()))


#graph with facet by country

top10_countries <- coronavirus %>%
