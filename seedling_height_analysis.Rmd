### Determine average total height at end of 2019



### Visualize data relationships

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

ht.data.com <- ht.avg %>% 
  filter(year == "2019")

ggplot(data=ht.data.com, mapping = aes(x=avg_basal, y = avg_ht, size = spp)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(size = spp), shape = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F) +
  facet_wrap(~origin, nrow=1) +
  theme_bw()
